# BookKing-Website PUSL2021
This is the project we are creating for our second-year computing group project module.

Online booking platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years, as consumers seek the 
convenience of being able to book services from the comfort of their own homes. Multi-service booking 
platforms offer a one-stop solution for consumers to book a wide range of services, such as travel, 
accommodation, activities, and transportation.<br>
The Multi-Service Booking Platform is a comprehensive digital solution designed to streamline and optimize 
the process of booking various services through a centralized platform. This platform caters to a wide range 
of industries, including but not limited to hospitality, wellness, transportation, and professional services. By 
offering a user-friendly interface and robust backend infrastructure, this platform aims to revolutionize the 
way consumers access and book services.
